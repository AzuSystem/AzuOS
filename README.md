## What does AzuOS offer?
An advantage of AzuOS being built on Web Technologies is it allows users and developers to easily customize their system and make it yours!
From a simple change in a theme file, to replacing a css file, to literally writing your own desktop script :3

All that is required for developers is decent experience with Vanilla Javascript and you're good to go üëç

## Why?
I know... it seems weird having a Desktop Environment based on Javascript and Python and this alone is enough to drive some people away, which is kinda understandable.
A Web-Based Desktop makes development faster and easier, even for those just forking the project. Although admittly, a desktop not written primarily with such languages is better.

## What does AzuOS run on?
AzuOS is built using Javascript & Python, however runs on top of [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org). _~~so I can say 'I use Arch btw :3'~~_

Theoretically, AzuOS can run on other linux systems, assuming they also use bash, you may need to replace some shell scripts with ones that work on your linux distro of choice.

FreeBSD could probably work too, although shell scripts may require rewriting too.

## Backstory
I (MTSyntho), come from a background of making OS Concepts using Windows Batch Scripting and Microsoft PowerPoint.

None of my creations were any good but I enjoyed making them either way, since those days it's been my dream to make my own functional OS to some degree.

And now 3 years later, in 2024, we have AzuOS, i'll never forget those amazing days ‚ù§Ô∏è
